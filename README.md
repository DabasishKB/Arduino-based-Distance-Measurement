# Arduino-based-Distance-Measurement

Certainly! Distance measurement using Arduino is a common application, and it can be achieved through various sensors. One popular sensor for this purpose is the ultrasonic sensor, particularly the HC-SR04. Here's a basic description of how you can create an Arduino-based distance measurement system using this sensor:

Components Needed:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
Breadboard and jumper wires
Optional: Display unit (LCD, LED, Serial Monitor)

Wiring:

Connect the VCC pin of the HC-SR04 to 5V on the Arduino.
Connect the GND pin of the HC-SR04 to GND on the Arduino.
Connect the Trig pin of the HC-SR04 to a digital pin (e.g., D9) on the Arduino.
Connect the Echo pin of the HC-SR04 to another digital pin (e.g., D10) on the Arduino.


How it Works:

The Arduino sends a pulse to the Trig pin of the HC-SR04 to trigger the sensor.
The sensor then sends out an ultrasonic wave.
The wave bounces off an object, and the sensor receives it.
The time taken for the wave to travel to the object and back is measured using the Echo pin.
The Arduino calculates the distance based on the time measured.
This distance value can be displayed on the Serial Monitor or used to control other components based on your project requirements. Adjustments to the code may be necessary based on the specific needs of your project
